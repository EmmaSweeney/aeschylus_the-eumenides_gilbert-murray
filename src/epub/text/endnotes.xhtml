					<p>The Scene is conceived as different in different parts of the play, but probably no actual change was made. A stage with the usual “House” background, representing a Temple or Castle, with a round orchestra (dancing floor) on a lower level in front, will suit all the needs of the action. A statue of Athena in place of the Omphalos Altar will turn the “House” from the Temple of Apollo at Delphi to that of Athena in Athens. A semi-circle of seats, or something similar, will symbolize the Areopagus. Compare the change of scene in the Choëphoroe, where Agamemnon’s Grave seems to be in the centre of the orchestra while the “House” represents the palace of Aigisthos, and the action of the play is now at one, now at the other. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>P. 10, l. 212. “ ’Twas not one blood”: It is the Furies who first raise this sophism about the “common blood.” In reality such a plea on behalf of a wife who had murdered her husband would no more be admitted in ancient law than in modern. But the Erînyes are supposed by the poet to represent (1) the primitive “matriarchal” society which preceded the introduction of marriage and civic life, and (2) a blind law based on purely physical considerations: hence Apollo’s answer: “Your insistence on the physical blood-tie destroys all moral values. It is love and trust, not mere blood, that matter.” He has also a physiological argument with which to meet their quibble in the trial scene (<abbr>p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_33">33</a>, l. 660). <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>P. 12, ll. 235 <abbr>ff.</abbr> Orestes has been hunted over the face of the world for years and has at last made his way, bleeding, to Athena’s Image in Athens. The Furies are only a short way behind, tracking him by the blood.</p>
					<p>The question has been raised what Image of Athena this is, and whether the scene is on the Acropolis or the Areopagus, or elsewhere. To ask such a question is to press too hard the ideal geography of ancient poetry. The scene is Athens, though sometimes we may have to think of one part of Athens rather than another. Similarly, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Helena</i> the scene is Egypt, though we are sometimes on the banks of the Nile, sometimes on the sea-shore, sometimes at the Isle of Pharos; so in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> the beacon from Troy to Argos starts from Mount Ida. The real Mount Ida was about thirty miles in the wrong direction, but the ideal Ida was simply the mountain of Troy. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>P. 14, l. 270. “Parent or guest or god”: These are the three classes of persons towards whom primitive man has duties: (1) the gods; (2) the kindred, in which the parents take the chief place; (3) those aliens to whom he had specially bound himself by the tie of hospitality. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>P. 14, l. 276. Orestes calls Athena to come to his aid, and explains that his touch does not defile her Image, and that he is at liberty to speak.⁠—The reasons are: first, it is so long ago and he has suffered so much. Even such a defilement as his does not last for ever. Secondly, he was fully purified at Delphi in the regular way, new blood (of swine) being poured upon him to cover the old blood, and then both washed off together. Thirdly, he has, as a matter of fact, spoken to many people with no bad results to them.⁠—It looks as if there was some ceremonial difficulty which Aeschylus had to meet, in making the unacquitted murderer embrace the Image of Athena or the Altar at Delphi. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>P. 15, ll. 293, 295. According to one legend, the epithet “Tritonia,” traditionally applied to Athena, meant that she was born at Lake Tritonis in Libya. Phlegra was the scene of the Battle between the Gods and Giants; it is interesting that Aeschylus seems to conceive it as a continuous battle, not an incident in the past. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>P. 15, l. 299. Orestes’ prayer is followed by silence; a pause and no answer. Then the triumphant cry of the Fury, and the Binding Song to fix his despair. Then at l. 397, when hope had failed, Athena’s entrance. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Pp. 16⁠–⁠19, ll. 321⁠–⁠396. This song falls into two parts: a solemn and even philosophical statement of the place of the Avengers in the Cosmos, and a magical chorus or “Binding Song,” sinister and terrifying. “Binding charms” or <i xml:lang="la">Defixiones</i> play a prominent part in ancient magic, and are sufficiently numerous to have a special volume of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Corpus Inscriptionum</i> to themselves.</p>
					<p>The Furies here explain that their business is to punish sin: they have no other function, and therefore are repugnant to the Gods⁠—much as a hangman or a mediaeval torturer is, or was, repellent to ordinary society.

					<p>P. 20, l. 400. Athena comes from Sigêum in the neighbourhood of Troy, which in the time of Aeschylus had long been part of the Athenian Empire.

				</li>
				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Pp. 20⁠–⁠22, ll. 415⁠–⁠435. The dialogue between Athena and the Furies is significant. They state their position impressively: to ordinary gods and mortals they are abominable, but Night loves them and “the wronged ones in the darkness” see in them their prayers personified. On the other hand, Athena’s question in l. 426, “What motive had he?” is just what they cannot answer or consider. “He has sinned; smite him,” is the whole of their doctrine.</p>
					<p>This explains the point about the oath. The Furies follow the old ordeal by oath: the only trial permitted to the accused man is that both parties can be made to swear. If the accused can swear that he did not commit the crime, well and good. If he cannot, he is guilty. This leaves out of account any inquiry into justification or extenuating circumstances or even intention. Hence Athena condemns it, and eventually substitutes a trial by free inquiry into the whole of the facts. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>P. 23, ll. 470 <abbr>ff.</abbr> “A mystery graver to decide Than mortal dreameth.” Because it involves the whole problem of forgiveness. To reject the suppliant who has tried his best to do right is an offence; yet to save a particular sinner from the due consequence of his sin is an offence too. If one guilty man is to go unpunished, what remains of the Law? Athena decides to found a tribunal to inquire into the whole case and decide as it may think just, and this is the origin of the famous Court of the Areopagus. The Furies, as soon as they hear of this new-fangled form of trial, are bewildered and begin to feel that they have been deceived. Their simple rule, that the doer shall suffer, is no longer holding good. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Pp. 24⁠–⁠27, ll. 490⁠–⁠565. The above leads on to the main argument of this fine lyric. “Spare the criminal, and the law is broken; and then there will be no protection for the helpless and innocent. Society cannot do without Fear, though of course it must be the Fear of Law. The righteous and law-fearing man may suffer, but is never utterly lost; the law-breaker may succeed for a time, but in the end he is destroyed.” <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-1" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Pp. 27 <abbr>ff.</abbr>, ll. 566⁠–⁠777. The Trial Scene, though curious, is perhaps below the level of the rest of the play. For one thing, I think it is deliberately set, like the play scene in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hamlet</i>, one remove further from reality. As the play in general is to real life, so is the Trial Scene to the play. Further, the acquittal of Orestes does not depend on the arguments used in the trial, but on the Will of Zeus, which is an ultimate fact not dependent on argument. The interest lies in the foundation of the Court of the Areopagus, as a tribunal superseding the blood-feud, the ordeal by oath, and all the rigid and unreasoning practices of primitive justice, by a justice which can understand and therefore sympathize.</p>

What none before hath given: <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> hitherto they have only gone by mechanical tests and ordeals; now they have tried to find the full truth. The Council of the Areopagus was a Council of Elders, of the type usual in ancient Indo-European Societies, reinforced, like the Roman Senate by the co-optation of all ex-magistrates (“Archontes”). It exercised a general supervision over the state, especially in matters of religious pollution. At the time of the Persian invasion it seems to have been the only organ of the constitution which held firm, and consequently for the next seventeen years it exercised a predominant influence over Athens. In the year 461⁠–⁠460, three years before this play, its political powers were severely cut down by the democratic party led by Ephialtes, but its jurisdiction in cases of blood-pollution was left. If we ask what the political bearing of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Eumenides</i> was, in a time of fierce party feeling, the answer is not hard to find.

It is difficult to say what particular plea of Athena’s won the Erînyes over, and transformed them to “Eumenides (Kindly Ones).” The effect of her patience and persuasion was cumulative. But l. 885 gives the essential test: “Do they believe in Persuasion, which is the gift of Zeus and the office of Athena?” That is, “Do they admit that there is a place in the Law for reason and understanding?” If so, they will accept their new position, expressing a truer law than the old. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Because the Chthonian (or underworld) Powers punish transgression by barrenness and similar curses, while they reward normal conduct by sending up the fruits of the Earth, including the young of animals and men. Also the old female goddesses, dating from matriarchal times, were naturally concerned with women’s affairs. <a href="the-eumenides.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
